PyCA â€“ Matterhorn Capture Agent
===============================

**PyCA** is a fully functional Opencast Matterhorn [MH]_ Capture Agent written
in about 300 lines Python code. It is free software licenced under the terms of
both the FreeBSD license and the LGPL. The target systems are primarily small
devices like the Raspberry Pi [RPi]_ although it can, of course, also run on a
normal PC without a problem.

Backup Mode
***********

By setting ``BACKUP_AGENT = False`` in the configuration file, the PyCA will go
into a backup mode. This means that capture agent will neither register itself
at the matterhorn core, nor try to ingest any of the recorded media or set the
capture state. This is useful if the CA shall be used as back-up in case a
regular capture agent fails to record (for whatever reasons). Just match the
name of the pyCA to that of the regular capture agent.

Installation
************

Here is a short summary for Debian based OS like Raspian::

  git clone https://github.com/lkiesow/pyCA.git
  cd pyCA
  sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv python-dev libcurl-gnutls-dev
  virtualenv venv
  . ./venv/bin/activate
  pip install icalendar python-dateutil pycurl
  vim pyca/config.py
  python pyca.py run

For RedHat bases systems like Fedora it's almost the same::

  git clone https://github.com/lkiesow/pyCA.git
  cd pyCA
  sudo yum install python-virtualenv
  virtualenv venv
  . ./venv/bin/activate
  pip install icalendar python-dateutil pycurl
  vim pyca/config.py  <-- Edit the configuration
  python pyca.py run

Todo
****
* Configuration
* Confidence monitoring
* Control page (manually start a recording, etc.)
* Create daemon mode
